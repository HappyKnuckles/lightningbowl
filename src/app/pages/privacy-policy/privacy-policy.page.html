      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Lightning Bowl ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store
        your information when you use our application.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following data when you use Lightning Bowl:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in via OAuth (Google, etc.), we receive your email address and profile name.</li>
        <li><strong>Game data:</strong> Bowling scores, game history, league data, and equipment information you enter into the app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use OAuth</h2>
      <p>
        OAuth is used exclusively for one-time authentication to verify your identity. After sign-in, we store a refresh token in our database solely
        to enable cloud synchronization of your bowling data across devices. We do not use OAuth tokens for any other purpose and do not share your
        credentials with third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Your bowling data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB. If you choose to enable cloud sync, your data is encrypted and stored
        securely on our servers. Refresh tokens required for cloud sync are stored in our database and are used only to maintain your session.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your data for as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us via
        the feedback form in the Settings page.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. To exercise these rights, please contact us through the app.</p>

      <h2>8. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the feedback form in the Settings page.</p>
